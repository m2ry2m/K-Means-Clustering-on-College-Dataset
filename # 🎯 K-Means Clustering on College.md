# 🎯 K-Means Clustering on College Dataset

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that uses the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to classify colleges as **Private** or **Public** based on their features — without using the actual labels during training.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is taken from the `College_Data.csv` file, which contains information about various US colleges, such as:

- Number of applications received
- Acceptance rate
- Graduation rate
- Student-to-faculty ratio
- Out-of-state tuition
- Room and board cost
- etc.

Each row represents one college.

---

## 🧠 Objective

Use **unsupervised learning** (K-Means) to cluster the colleges into 2 groups:
- Group 0
- Group 1

Then compare the clustering results to the actual labels (`Private` or `Public`) to evaluate performance.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for optional visualization)

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Load and clean the data
2. Convert the `Private` column to numerical values
3. Normalize the feature values
4. Apply `KMeans` with `n_clusters=2`
5. Compare the predicted clusters with actual labels using a **confusion matrix**
6. Calculate and display **accuracy**

## 📊 Evaluation Summary

       Confusion Matrix

           Predicted
         0           1
      -------------------

✅ In our case, the model achieved around **93% accuracy**, which is great considering it's completely unsupervised!
